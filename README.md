# SMC
Simple Manager of Content

## Why?

Why not? Every developer needs to create a content management system (or two) at some point in their career.
There are many like it, but this one is mine.

It's mostly for experimenting with web technologies, language features, ideas and tools.
The tools might not be new, but some of them I have limited experience with, and I want to learn more.

The goal is to keep it simple and easy to understand.
This is not meant in any way to be a production ready CMS.

## What?

### Project tools

- Git
- GitHub
- GitHub Actions
- GitHub Dependabot
- Docker / Docker Compose
- Changelog

### PHP

- PHP 8.3 / 8.4
- PHPUnit
- Xdebug
- PSR-12 / PER-CS
- Code linting tool(s) like PHPStan, Psalm and PHP_CodeSniffer

### HTML and CSS

Trying to catch up with the latest standards and best practices.
No frameworks? Modern CSS only?

### Database

Redis?

### JavaScript

- Vue 3 / Vite?
- Bun? Parcel? Rollup?
- TypeScript?
- Selenium? Playwright?
- Linting and formatting?

Time will tell...

## When?

Probably too late, but I'm doing it anyway.

## Where?

To be determined.
